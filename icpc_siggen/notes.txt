TO DO:

- measure cpu time and try to optimize 
    - lots of redundant operations in efield_exists()
    - if vel << grid size, calculate dq/dt, number of steps?
    - can we combine calls grid_weights?
    	  - ipt and w in setup? also rlen, zlen, etc?
- mjd_fieldgen: add partial voxel-filling for outer contact and ditch?

Done:

8 Dec 2014 - added capacitance calculation following WP calculation
           - added proper handling of undepleted voxels in WP calculation
	   - can now calculate realistic signals without full depletion
12-20 Dec 2014 - added charge cloud self-repulsion
               - added field dependence of diffusion coefficient
	       - added surface charge, quadratic charge profile, radial charge profiles
	       - added logging of config params to start of field and WP files

- added li_thickness, bulletization, etc to fieldgen
- added over-relaxation to fieldgen, significant speed improvement
